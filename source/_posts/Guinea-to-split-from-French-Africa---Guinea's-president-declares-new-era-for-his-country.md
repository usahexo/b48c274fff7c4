#  Guinea to split from French Africa - Guinea's president declares new era for his country

The Republic of Guinea has become the first country in French Africa to break away from France and declare itself an independent republic. In a speech on national television, president Lansana Conte announced that the move was "the end of one era and the beginning of another."

He went on to say that Guinea would now be ruled by its own people, through a government chosen by the people. This marks a dramatic change for a country which has been closely tied to France since it gained independence in 1958.

President Conte said that he had made the decision after long consultations with the people of Guinea. "We have decided to free ourselves from all forms of domination, economic, political or military," he said.

Guinea's move comes at a time of growing criticism of France's colonial past in Africa. Last year, France faced street protests across the continent after it refused to apologize for its role in the slave trade.

In a sign of things to come, President Conte announced that Guinea would now be seeking closer ties with other countries in Africa and beyond. He said that his country would be embarking on a new course, based on democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law.

#  Guinea becomes first Francophone country to use the CFA franc

Guinea has announced that it will switch its currency from the Guinea franc to the CFA franc, making it the first Francophone country to use the common African currency. The CFA franc is used by a number of African countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Mali.

The decision was made in order to improve trade with other CFA franc-using countries and to make it easier for Guineans to do business on the continent. The switchover will take place on 1 January 2019.

The move has been welcomed by the IMF and other organisations, who say that it will help promote economic stability and growth in Guinea. However, some local business owners are concerned that the switch could lead to an increase in prices as Guinea moves from a weak currency to a stronger one.

#  How does divide work in blackjack Guinea: a case study

The game of blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by obtaining 21 points or a score closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over.

There are many different ways to play blackjack, but the most common version is where each player is dealt two cards and must decide whether to ‘stand’ (take no more cards), ‘hit’ (draw one more card) or ‘double down’ (double their bet and receive just one more card). If the player has a total of 21 points with their first two cards (an ace and a ten-point card), they win automatically.

The dealer then takes two cards, one face up and one face down. The upcard determines how many cards the dealer will take (usually between one and four), while the downcard decides whether the dealer hits or stands on soft 17 (see below). A blackjack hand comprises an ace and any ten-point card, such as a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.

If both players have blackjacks, it is a push (a tie), and if either player has 21 points with their first two cards, that player wins regardless of what the dealer has. In order to win at blackjack, you need to get closer to 21 points than the dealer without going over.

If you have more than 21 points at any stage in the game, you bust and lose regardless of what the dealer has. If your first two cards add up to less than 21 points, you can choose to take another card in an attempt to reach 21 – this is known as hitting. You can also choose to stand if you are happy with your total.

If your first two cards are an ace and a ten-point card (such as a jack or queen), you can choose to double down on your bet – this means that you place another bet equal to your original bet and receive just one more card. You cannot hit after doubling down.

In some versions of blackjack, including online casinos such as Royal Vegas Casino [1], there is also an option called surrender which allows players to forfeit half their bet even after they have seen their first two cards. This is useful when you think that the dealer has a better hand than you do. However surrender is not always available so always check before playing.

So now that we know how to play blackjack basic gameplay mechanics we can move onto discussing different variants found in casinos around the world 

  

 There are a few slight rule variations between different countries when it comes playing Blackjack; for example - Double Down rules may vary along with taking insurance etc.. But by far and away -the biggest difference between versions played around thw world - come in relation ot how dealers hit on soft 17s . lets explore this in further detail:

 When playing Blackjack at a casino around North America for example - Dealers hit on all soft 17s - which essentially means they hit if thier upcard totals either 6 or 17 . So theoretically - if playing at a casino like Niagara Falls Canada for example - if dealt Ace & 6 (soft 17) versus Dealers 4 , Dealer would hit giving themselves a total of 20 . Contrast this against Casino's found say within Europe such as those within U.K , where generally Dealers Stand on all soft 17s ; which would see them Stand if facing same situation ( Ace & 6 ) versusDealers 4 . As can be seen , arguably softer rules towards dealers favours Player overall when statistically compared hands being played out .

 Another global variance noted amongst Blackjack players come in relation taking insurance prior t o Dealer's exposed card being revealed . In general terms , taking insurance is typically frowned upon by experienced Blackjack Players who deem it less advantageous due its negative expected value (-EV) ; however wager still may be offered much in part due house edge % attached should player opt-in . Within U . S gambling venues for example , Players are generally expected make decision whether insuring hand post initial deal i . e before Dealer exposes any hole-cards ; whilst Players within European Casinos tend allow make decision whether insure once Dealer's second card revealed .
