#  PokerStars NJ introduces Metropolitans 92 – a new variant for high rollers

On July 9, PokerStars NJ announced the launch of a new high stakes poker game – Metropolitans 92. The game is a variant of No Limit Texas Hold’em that is played with a deck of only 92 cards.

The game is designed for high rollers, with blinds starting at $100 and going up to $10,000. The maximum buy-in is also set at $10,000.

Metropolitans 92 is just the latest in a series of new games that PokerStars has been introducing to its New Jersey online poker platform. In May, the site launched Speed Poker, which is a fast-paced version of traditional Texas Hold’em. And in June, it introduced Omaha Hi-Lo Split 8 or Better, which is a variant of Omaha poker that offers players the chance to win both high and low hands.

#  Metropolitans 92: The most action-packed poker game around

Getting out and playing some poker is always a great way to spend an evening, but there’s nothing like a good old-fashioned game of Metropolitan 92 to get the blood pumping. This high-action variant of poker is played with a regular deck of cards and just two players - making for a fast, furious and highly strategic contest.

The key to success in Metropolitan 92 is to think ahead, constantly considering what your opponent might be holding and what cards are left in the deck.

#  How to win at Metropolitans 92 – strategy tips from the pros

It’s the final match of the Metropolitans season. Your team, the Blues, is playing against the Sharks. The stakes are high – the winner will take home the cup, and the loser will go home empty-handed.

You’ve been following the Sharks throughout the season, and you know their strengths and weaknesses. You also know your own team’s strengths and weaknesses. But how do you put all this information together to create a winning strategy?

In this article, we’ll look at some tips for winning at Metropolitans 92 from the pros.

1. Know your team’s strengths and weaknesses

Your first step is to figure out what your team does well and where they are weak. For example, if your team is good at passing but weak at defending, you’ll want to focus on attacking rather than defending.

2. Figure out your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses

Next, you need to figure out your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses. This can be tricky – after all, you don’t want to give away your own plans! But studying your opponent’s stats can help you get a general idea of where they are strong and where they are weak.

3. Create a plan based on your team’s strengths and your opponent’s weaknesses

Now it’s time to put all this information together to create a winning strategy. If your team is strong offensively but weak defensively, you might want to consider playing a high-scoring game with lots of goals. Alternatively, if your opponent is weak defensively but strong offensively, you might want to focus on defending instead.


 4. Stay calm under pressure

One of the key skills in Metropolitans 92 is being able to stay calm under pressure. When things start going wrong – for example, when you lose a player or when one of your players makes a mistake – it can be easy to panic. But panicking will only make things worse! Instead, take a deep breath and try to stay calm so that you can come up with a plan B.
