# City In Spotlight As Casino Goes All-In On Deck

Las Vegas, Nevada is a city that is used to being in the spotlight. However, a new development has thrust it into the national conversation once again. The announcement that the Wynn Casino Resort is going all-in on a new $4.3 billion deck project has made headlines across the country.

The project, which is expected to be completed in 2020, will add an additional 3,000 hotel rooms and a massive showroom to the Wynn property. It is also expected to create thousands of jobs in the process. This comes as good news for a city that has been struggling in recent years thanks to the downturn in the tourism industry.

It's not just the Wynn Casino Resort that is doubling down on its investment in Las Vegas. MGM Resorts International has also announced plans for a new $3.7 billion expansion project at its Mandalay Bay property. This project will add 2,500 new hotel rooms to the resort and is expected to be completed by 2022.

These projects are a sign that Las Vegas is determined to bounce back from its recent slump. And with so much money being invested in new attractions and facilities, it's clear that casino operators believe that Las Vegas still has plenty of appeal for tourists from around the world.

# Casino Hopes New Game Will Attract More Players

The casino industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow each year. There are many different types of casinos, but they all have one common goal: to make money. One way they do this is by introducing new games to attract players. Recently, casinos have been introducing skill-based games in an attempt to lure in those who are looking for a more interactive experience.

One such game is called “Final Shootout” and it’s been making its way around the country. The premise of the game is simple: there are two teams of players and each team has a set of goals. The first team to achieve their goals or the team with the most goals at the end of the round wins. What makes this game unique is that it requires skill and strategy in order to win. This sets it apart from games like blackjack or craps, which rely more on chance.

Casinos hope that games like Final Shootout will attract more people to their properties. In addition, they hope that these games will keep players engaged for longer periods of time, which will result in them spending more money. So far, it seems to be working as these games continue to gain in popularity.
