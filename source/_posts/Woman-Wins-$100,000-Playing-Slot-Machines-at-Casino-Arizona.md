It was only her second time ever playing slot machines at a casino, but that didn't stop local woman Nadia G. from winning big. On Saturday, she walked away with more than $100,000 after playing at Casino Arizona for just a few hours.

G. said that she originally went to the casino with the intent of just having some fun and relaxation. However, once she started playing the slots, she couldn't help but keep winning. "Every time I would put money in, I'd win," she said. "I just couldn't lose."

In fact, G. managed to hit the jackpot on two different machines over the course of her visit to Casino Arizona. Altogether, she won more than $102,000 on slot machines over the course of just a few hours - an impressive feat by any standards.
