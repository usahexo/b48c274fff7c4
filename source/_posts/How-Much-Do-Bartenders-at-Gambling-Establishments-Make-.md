#  How Much Do Bartenders at Gambling Establishments Make? 

It’s not a well-known profession, but bartending at a gambling establishment can be a lucrative career. How much do these bartenders make, and what sort of tips can they expect?

The starting salary for a bartender in a casino is usually around $12 an hour. However, with gratuities, their income can be much higher. In some places, the waitstaff can make as much as $50 an hour in tips. 

So what determines how much a bartender makes in tips? It varies depending on the establishment, but generally speaking, the more prestigious the casino, the higher the tips. And obviously, how good the bartender is at their job also factors in. But on average, bartenders can expect to make anywhere from $20 to $100 in tips per shift. 

Obviously, the amount of money that can be made as a bartender at a gambling establishment varies greatly depending on the individual casino and the city it’s located in. But on average, it’s a fairly decent-paying job with excellent tips potential.

#  Study Shows Bartenders at Gambling Establishments Make Less Than Minimum Wage 

A recent study conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has found that bartenders at gambling establishments make less than minimum wage. 

The study, which was published in a recent issue of the journal "Gambling Research", surveyed 302 bartenders working at casinos and other gambling establishments in the Las Vegas area. The study found that the median wage for these bartenders was only $8.00 per hour, well below the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. 

The study also found that nearly one-third of the bartenders surveyed were paid less than the minimum wage. In addition, the study found that more than half of the bartenders worked fewer than 40 hours per week, meaning they earned less than $15,000 per year. 

The president of UNLV's chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which sponsored the study, said that the findings show that casino and gaming industry workers are "among the lowest-paid workers in our economy". He added that “the state should be doing more to ensure these workers are earning a livable wage”. 

A representative for the Nevada Gaming Commission said that the commission is currently studying ways to improve working conditions for casino and gaming industry employees.

#  Local Bartenders Outraged Over Casino Policies 

Local bartenders are outraged over new casino policies that prohibit them from serving alcohol to customers who are not actively gambling.

"I've been a bartender for ten years and this is the first time I've been told I can't serve someone a drink just because they're not gambling," said one local bartender. "It's ridiculous."

Many bartenders are concerned that the new policy will hurt their business, especially since casinos are such a popular tourist destination. Some have even threatened to boycott the casinos altogether.

"I'm not going to stand for this," said one bartender. "Casinos should be about giving people a good time, not making it harder for us to do our job."

#  Are Casino Bartenders Penalized for Not Selling Drinks? 

Casino bartenders can be penalized for not selling drinks. This is especially true if the casino is attempting to promote itself as a place where people can come and drink.

There are a few different ways that bartenders can be penalized for not selling drinks. One way is that they may lose their shift. Another way is that they may be docked pay. And, finally, they may even be fired from their job.

Most casinos have a policy that states that bartenders must sell drinks in order to keep their job. This policy is in place because casinos want to make sure that their customers are taken care of and that they are able to purchase alcoholic beverages if they want to.

Bartenders who do not sell drinks may find themselves in trouble with their boss. This can result in lost wages or even losing their job altogether.

#  Casino Bartenders Struggle to Survive on Low Wages

Casino bartenders are struggling to make ends meet on their low wages, according to a new report.

The report, from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), says that casino bartenders in Las Vegas, Nevada earn an average of just $9.00 an hour, which is well below the city’s median wage.

“Bartenders in casinos are paid poverty-level wages, and many are forced to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet,” said SEIU Secretary-Treasurer treasurer Rocio Sotelo.

Sotelo noted that the union is calling for casino bartenders to be paid a living wage of $15 an hour.

The report comes as the union gears up for contract negotiations with several Las Vegas casinos.

Those negotiations are expected to be tough, as casinos are facing tough financial times due to declining visitation levels.
