People who have been following the industry for a while now will know that Grand Loot machines (GLMs) are one of the best ways to make money. They are simple and easy to use, yet can be lucrative if used correctly.

There are many tips and strategies floating around on how to make money from GLMs, but we have narrowed it down to the five most effective ones. Here they are:

1. Timing is everything

The first tip is to be aware of when the busiest times at the GLM are. Generally, these will be during peak hours – early in the morning and evening, as well as during lunchtime. If you can time your visits accordingly, you’ll be able to maximise your chances of winning big!

2. Bet big, win bigger

Whenever possible, aim for the bonus rounds on GLMs. These offer the biggest potential payouts, so they’re definitely worth aiming for!

5. Have fun!
