#  Lakers Lose Game After Slot Machine Malfunctions In Las Vegas 

The Lakers were on a road trip in Las Vegas and were looking to take a break from their poor play with some gambling. Unfortunately for them, the slot machines they were playing malfunctioned and they lost the game.

It was a close game throughout, but the Lakers couldn't overcome the bad luck caused by the malfunctioning machines. They ended up losing 92-91 and have now dropped to 11-27 on the season.

It's been a tough year for the Lakers, and this latest setback is just another example of that. They'll need to turn things around soon if they want to avoid missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year.

#  Warriors Suffer Huge Setback After Slot Machine Malfunction 

OAKLAND, Calif. — Warriors fans had something to cheer about in the first half of Wednesday night’s game against the Pelicans. But that all changed in the second half, when a malfunctioning slot machine caused a huge setback for the team.

With the Warriors leading by 13 points at halftime, officials were forced to shut down the slot machine after it began spewing out cash and free tickets. Players and fans were left in disbelief as the machine continued to malfunction, issuing large payouts to lucky winners who were quickly filling the arena with screams of joy.

The fiasco seemed to sap the energy from the Warriors players, who went on to lose by 20 points. Coach Steve Kerr was visibly frustrated after the game, calling the malfunction “a complete distraction”. “It’s just unfortunate that something like this can have such a negative impact on the team,” he said.

Warriors owner Joe Lacob was unavailable for comment, but sources say he is considering filing a lawsuit against the casino where the machine is located. In a statement released earlier today, Lacob said “we are disgusted by what happened last night. This was a deliberate act by someone or someones at that casino, and we intend to get to the bottom of it.”

The Warriors now find themselves in a difficult position as they prepare for Game 6 of their playoff series against New Orleans. With their backs against the wall, they will need to overcome not only their opponents on the court, but also this latest setback off it.

#  Cavaliers Lose Due To Slot Machine Malfunction During Preseason Game 

The Cleveland Cavaliers lost a preseason game on Monday night after a slot machine in the arena malfunctioned, spewing out $825,000 worth of free tickets.

The game continued after the machine started doling out tickets, but the Cavaliers eventually lost to the Washington Wizards 113-110. Team officials said that the malfunction was not a factor in the loss.

“Everybody was looking over at it and people were getting rowdy because they thought it was funny,” said Wizard forward Markieff Morris. “It was just pandemonium for awhile. It was kind of chaotic. But it was all good though. It didn’t affect the game at all.”

The machine is owned by Jackpot Jester 50,000, an online casino company, and is one of six such machines at Quicken Loans Arena. A team spokesman said that the machine had been properly serviced and inspected before the game.

In a statement, a Jackpot Jester 50,000 spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that one of our machines in Quicken Loans Arena malfunctioned last night resulting in tickets being dispensed externally. We are working with venue staff to investigate the matter and will ensure that any affected customers are compensated accordingly.”

Quicken Loans Arena is one of the busiest venues in North America, hosting more than 20 sports and entertainment events each year.

#  Rockets Lose In Final Seconds To Thunder After Slot Machine Malfunction 

The Rockets had a heartbreaking loss on Wednesday night against the Thunder. The game was tied at the end of regulation, but the Rockets lost in overtime after a slot machine malfunctioned in their favor.

There was some confusion as to whether or not the Rockets should have been given the ball after the machine stopped working. It was ultimately ruled that the Thunder would get possession of the ball, and they eventually went on to win the game.

It was a close game throughout, with neither team leading by more than six points at any point. The Rockets had an opportunity to win in regulation, but they missed a shot with just seconds left on the clock.

James Harden had a great game for the Rockets, scoring 38 points while shooting effectively from both inside and outside the paint. Westbrook led the Thunder with 34 points, and Paul George chipped in with 29 points.

The Rockets are now 47-22 on the season and sit in third place in the Western Conference. They will next face off against the Lakers on Friday night.

#  Slot Machine Malfunction Causes Celtics To Lose In Overtime

A slot machine malfunction caused the Boston Celtics to lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime last night.

The game was tied at 107 with 5.8 seconds left in overtime when Celtics guard Kyrie Irving took a shot that appeared to be heading in, but instead hit the rim and bounced out.

“I thought it was going in,” Irving said after the game. “It sucks when something like that happens.”

The Celtics then had a chance to win the game in regulation, but Jayson Tatum’s last-second jumper clanged off the backboard and rim.

And then, in overtime, the slot machine malfunctioned.

The Celtics had been enjoying a big lead for most of the game until the machine started spitting out winners for the 76ers. The trend continued in overtime, with Philadelphia winning four of the five sudden-death minutes.

“I don’t know what happened,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the game. “We were up by 20 points at one point and then the machine went nuts and they started winning all these shots. It was definitely an unfortunate turn of events.”
