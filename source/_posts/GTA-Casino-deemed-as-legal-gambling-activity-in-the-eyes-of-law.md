#  GTA Casino enhances reputation of legal gambling in Canada

Ontario’s Great Toronto Area (GTA) is home to a new casino that has been in operation since late summer 2017. The GTA Casino is part of the new Parx Eldorado Resort and Spa, which is situated in the town of Breslau, about an hour west of Toronto.

The opening of the GTA Casino is good news for the legal gambling industry in Canada. For years, Ontario has been without a major commercial gambling venue, with the only options being small casinos or racetracks with slots. The GTA Casino changes that, as it offers a full range of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. It’s also open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making it a convenient option for gamblers in the Toronto area.

The GTA Casino is part of a larger trend towards legal gambling in Canada. In recent years, several new casinos have opened across the country, including ones in Niagara Falls, Ottawa, and Montréal. This growth is fuelled by increased interest in gambling among Canadian players. According to a study by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA), Canadians lose nearly $10 billion each year to illegal gambling activities such as online poker and sports betting. By contrast, legal gambling generates over $15 billion in revenue for provincial governments and creates tens of thousands of jobs.

The opening of the GTA Casino is good news for both players and government coffers alike. With its convenient location and wide range of games available, it is sure to be a popular destination for Torontonians looking to gamble legally. At the same time, its presence helps legitimize gambling as an important source of revenue for provincial governments across Canada.
