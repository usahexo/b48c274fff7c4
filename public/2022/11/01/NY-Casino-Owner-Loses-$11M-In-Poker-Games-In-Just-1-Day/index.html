      		<h1 id="NY-Casino-Owner-Loses-11M-In-Poker-Games-In-Just-1-Day"><a href="#NY-Casino-Owner-Loses-11M-In-Poker-Games-In-Just-1-Day" class="headerlink" title="NY Casino Owner Loses $11M In Poker Games In Just 1 Day"></a>NY Casino Owner Loses $11M In Poker Games In Just 1 Day</h1><p> Casino mogul and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson lost nearly $11 million playing poker in one day this week, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Adelson, who is said to have a net worth of $37.5 billion, was playing high-stakes games at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas on Tuesday when he lost the vast majority of his cash.</p>
<p>Adelson is no stranger to big bets; he famously donated $25 million to President Donald Trump’s election campaign in 2016. But even by his lofty standards, Tuesday’s losses were staggering.</p>
<p>In total, Adelson dropped more than $20 million on various games at the Wynn over the past two days. His biggest loss of the day came when he went all in with ace-king against an opponent holding pocket queens and lost $10.2 million.</p>
<p>Adelson’s spokesperson told the WSJ that the casino owner was “taking some time off” after his big losses this week.</p>
<h1 id="Owner-Of-NY-Casino-Loses-Millions-In-Poker-Games"><a href="#Owner-Of-NY-Casino-Loses-Millions-In-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="Owner Of NY Casino Loses Millions In Poker Games"></a>Owner Of NY Casino Loses Millions In Poker Games</h1><p>The owner of a prestigious New York City casino has lost millions of dollars in poker games over the last several months, according to reports.</p>
<p>The unidentified casino owner has been playing high-stakes poker games with several wealthy business executives, and has reportedly lost more than $10 million since last fall.</p>
<p>One insider familiar with the situation said that the casino owner has been “taking it on the chin” in recent months, and is now even being forced to sell some of his personal assets in order to cover his losses.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why the casino owner is losing so much money at poker, but some believe that he may be overmatched by his opponents.</p>
<p>“He’s playing against people who are much more experienced than he is, and they’re taking advantage of him,” said one source. “It’s been pretty costly for him.”</p>
<p>The casino owner has not commented on his losses, but it’s clear that he’s not having a good year. Here’s hoping he can turn things around before it’s too late.</p>
<h1 id="NY-Casino-Owner-Bets-Big-Loses-Big-In-Poker-Games"><a href="#NY-Casino-Owner-Bets-Big-Loses-Big-In-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="NY Casino Owner Bets Big, Loses Big In Poker Games"></a>NY Casino Owner Bets Big, Loses Big In Poker Games</h1><p>It was revealed this week that casino owner and entrepreneur, Sheldon Adelson, lost a reported $250 million in just two months playing poker.</p>
<p>Adelson, who is estimated to be worth over $30 billion, was apparently playing high-stakes games at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas. The games were said to be played with some of the most well-known professional poker players in the world, including Phil Ivey and Antonio Esfandiari.</p>
<p>Adelson’s losses are thought to be the biggest in poker history and eclipses the previous record held by American businessman Terrence Watanabe, who lost around $150 million between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p>In a statement released this week, a spokesperson for the Venetian said: “Sheldon Adelson is a great patron of ours and has been for many years. He is an avid poker player and continues to play at the highest level. We are happy to have him as part of our community.”</p>
<p>While Adelson may have lost big in the poker games, he has still enjoyed plenty of success in business. He founded theLas Vegas Sands Corporation in 1988 and has since become one of the richest men in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owner-In-Beamus-Point-NY-Loses-Huge-Sums-In-Poker-Games"><a href="#Casino-Owner-In-Beamus-Point-NY-Loses-Huge-Sums-In-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owner In Beamus Point, NY Loses Huge Sums In Poker Games"></a>Casino Owner In Beamus Point, NY Loses Huge Sums In Poker Games</h1><p>When casino owner in Beamus Point, NY, decided to start hosting poker games in his establishment, he had no idea that he would be losing so much money. In just a few short months, the casino owner has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in poker games.</p>
<p>While some people may see this as a negative thing, the casino owner actually sees it as a positive learning experience. He has learned that he is not very good at playing poker and needs to find better ways to protect his money.</p>
<p>In addition to losing money in the poker games, the casino owner has also had to deal with some negative publicity. Some members of the community have accused him of being involved in illegal activities. However, the casino owner denies these allegations and insists that he is doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Despite the negative publicity and financial losses, the casino owner plans to continue hosting poker games at his establishment. He believes that there is still potential for profit and plans to do everything he can to make sure that his casino is successful.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owner-In-NY-Watch-As-Millions-Go-Up-In-Smoke-In-Poker-Games"><a href="#Casino-Owner-In-NY-Watch-As-Millions-Go-Up-In-Smoke-In-Poker-Games" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owner In NY Watch As Millions Go Up In Smoke In Poker Games"></a>Casino Owner In NY Watch As Millions Go Up In Smoke In Poker Games</h1><p>In a recently reported story, casino owner in upstate New York is said to be losing millions of dollars as players at his establishment engage in high-stakes poker games. The games are said to be so high-stakes that many of the players are thought to be using illegal means to finance their play, including loan sharking and money laundering.</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly how much money the casino owner is losing, but estimates put it in the tens of millions of dollars. In fact, some insiders say that the owner may soon be forced to close down the casino entirely as a result of these losses.</p>
<p>The poker games at this particular casino are said to be especially high-stakes because of the presence of several professional gamblers who regularly attend. These players are thought to be able to win or lose thousands of dollars in a single hand. As a result, other players are often willing to risk large sums of money in order to take them on.</p>
<p>While it’s not clear whether or not the casino owner will actually have to close his business due to these losses, it’s certainly an unfortunate turn of events for him. It’s also a sobering reminder that even those who operate casinos can sometimes lose big when it comes to gambling games.</p>
